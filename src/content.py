OVERVIEW = """
Welcome to **The Blue Pill** - *Week {week}, {year}*. A weekly update covering what's been happening across the Yearn ecosystem.

This newsletter is meant to be a simple summary of recent activity: governance discussions, vault performance, a few protocol-level metrics, and once in a while some alpha we can share. We hope you'll find it useful!

Time seems to be moving faster than ever, but work at Yearn continues steadily. Our agenda for today:
- **Yearn at a glance** - high-level protocol metrics, including TVL and week-over-week changes
- **Vaults** - top yields across chains
- **yCRV** - this week's fees and week-over-week changes
- **yYB** - this week's fees and week-over-week changes
- **Alpha Corner** - features and strategies in development
